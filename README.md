Welcome to the Data Job Analysis SQL Project!

ðŸ“ŠBy leveraging SQL, this project highlights top-paying jobs, in-demand skills and helps to choose the optimal career path. 

My SQL queries can be checked out here: [project_sql folder](/project_sql/)

# Background 
While I was studyng SQL, I had an opportunty to use a dataset which is packed with insights on

ðŸ“Œjob titles, 
ðŸ“Œsalaries, ðŸ“Œlocations, and ðŸ“Œssential skills. 

The project itself aimed to demonstrate not only my SQL skills, but also overall workforce dynamics, pinpointing in-demand and top-paying skills. 

### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were: 

1. What are the top paying data analyst jobs? 
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in-demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries? 
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn? 

# Tools I used 
ðŸ“ˆTo conduct a critical analysis of the data job market, I have used the power of several tools: 

- **SQL:** this powerful tool allowed me to unearth meaningful observations by quering the database. 
- **PostgreSQL:** The chosen database management system is perfect for handling this type of data. 
- **Visual Studio Code:** My preferred option for executing SQL queries. 
- **Git & GitHub:** Key to sharing my projects, in this case, my SQL scripts and analysis. 

# The analysis 
Each of the 5 queries aimed to explore specific aspects of data analyst job market. My approach to those questions is summarised below: 

### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs
ðŸ§©To identify the highest paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions by average salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights top opportunities in this workforce field. 

```sql
SELECT 
    job_id,
    job_title,
    company_dim.name as company_name,
    job_location,
    job_posted_date,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg
FROM 
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE 
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' 
    AND job_location = 'Anywhere'
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC; 
```
Here is the breakdown of the top data analyst jobs in 2023: 
- **Broad Salary Spectrum:** Top 10 roles span from $184,000 to $650,000, meaning that there is notable salary potential in the field. 
- **Diverse Employers:** SmartAsset, Meta, and AT&T offer the highest salaries. 
- **Job Title Variety:** There are multiple options in roles, as job titles vary from Data Analyst to Director of Analytics.

### 2. What skills are required for top paying roles? 
ðŸ§©To find out what skills are required for top-paying jobs, I have joined the job postings table with skills data. This provides information on what skills companies value most.  

```sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS (
    SELECT 
    job_id,
    job_title,
    salary_year_avg
FROM 
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE 
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' 
    AND job_location = 'Anywhere'
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY salary_year_avg desc

)

SELECT 
    top_paying_jobs.*, 
    skills
FROM 
    top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim 
    ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim 
    ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY 
    salary_year_avg DESC;

```

Here are some discoveries on demanded skills: 
- **SQL** is leading with a count of 8.
- **Python** is not far behind with a count of 7.
- **Tableau** has a count of 6, which is also significant. 

### 3. What are the most in-demand skills for Data Analysts? 
ðŸ§©This query highlighted the most commonly requested skills in job postings, guiding attention to areas of high demand.

```sql 
SELECT 
    skills, 
    COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demand_count
FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim 
    ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim 
    ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND job_work_from_home = True
GROUP BY 
    skills
ORDER BY 
    demand_count DESC; 
```

- Tools like **SQL and Excel** remain the most wanted, implying the need for foundation in data processing and spreadsheet manipulation. 
- **Python, Tableau and Power BI**, which are used for programming and visualization remain essential, emphasizing importance of skills in data storytelling. 

### 4. What are the top paying skills based on salary?
ðŸ§©Exploring the average salary that associated with each skill helped identify which skills are best paying. 

```sql
SELECT 
    skills, 
    ROUND(AVG(salary_year_avg), 0) as average_salary
FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim 
    ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim 
    ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 
    skills
ORDER BY 
    average_salary DESC; 
``` 

- Analysts who are skilled with **ML tools and Big Data technologies** are in high demand now, revealing that industry values predictive modeling and data processing capabilities. 
- Knowledge in **development and deployment** tools indicates the crossover between data analysis and engineering. 
- The analysis helped to understand the growing need for **cloud computing expertise**, meaning that cloud proficiency is a helful skill for data analytics. 

### 5. What are the most optimal skill to learn?

ðŸ§©In order to identify a startegy for job hunting and skills development, I have combined insights from demand and salary data, indicating skills that are in high demand and are top-paying. 

```sql 
WITH skills_demand AS (
    SELECT    
    skills_dim.skill_id, 
    skills_dim.skills, 
    COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demand_count
FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim 
    ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim 
    ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
     AND job_work_from_home = True
     AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 
    skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY 
    demand_count DESC
), 

average_salary AS (
    SELECT 
    skills_job_dim.skill_id,
    ROUND(AVG(salary_year_avg), 0) as average_salary
FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim 
    ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim 
    ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' 
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    AND  job_work_from_home = True
GROUP BY 
    skills_job_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY 
    average_salary DESC 
)

SELECT 
    skills_demand.skill_id, 
    skills_demand.skills,
    skills_demand.demand_count,
    average_salary.average_salary
FROM skills_demand
INNER JOIN average_salary ON skills_demand.skill_id = average_salary.skill_id
WHERE demand_count > 10
ORDER BY 
    average_salary DESC, 
    demand_count DESC; 
```

- Proficiency in **Python and R** highly valued and widely available, as their demand counts for 236 and 148, respectively. Average salaries are $101,397 for Python and $100,499 for R. 
- Skills in **cloud tools and technologies** also show high demand and relatively high salaries. 
- **Visualization and BI tools** also highlight the critical role of business intelligence in data analysis. 
- **Database technologies** also show high average salaries and demand, implying the need for data management and storage.
